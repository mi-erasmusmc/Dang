Glivec is indicated for the treatment of
 adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive(Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is notconsidered as the first line of treatment.
 adult and paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alphatherapy, or in accelerated phase or blast crisis.
 adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acutelymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.
 adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy.
 adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated withplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements.
 adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilicleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFR rearrangement.
The effect of Glivec on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.
Glivec is indicated for
 the treatment of adult patients with Kit (CD 117) positive unresectable and/or metastaticmalignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).
 the adjuvant treatment of adult patients who are at significant risk of relapse followingresection of Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrenceshould not receive adjuvant treatment.
 the treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) andadult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery.
3In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of Glivec is based on overall haematological andcytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogeneticresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and onobjective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST and DFSP and onrecurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with Glivec in patients with MDS/MPDassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). Except in newlydiagnosed chronic phase CML, there are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit orincreased survival for these diseases.

-Indication:
Leflunomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis as a"disease modifying antirheumatic drug" (DMARD).
Recent or concurrent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) mayresult in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions; therefore, the initiation of leflunomidetreatment has to be carefully considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects.
Moreover, switching from leflunomide to another DMARD without following the washout procedure(see section 4.4) may also increase the risk of serious adverse reactions even for a long time after theswitching.
4.2  Posology and method of administrationThe treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialists experienced in the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum glutamopyruvate transferase (SGPT) and a complete bloodcell count, including a differential white blood cell count and a platelet count, must be checkedsimultaneously and with the same frequency:
• before initiation of leflunomide,• every two weeks during the first six months of treatment, and• every 8 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4).
PosologyMedicinal productnolongerauthorised3• In rheumatoid arthritis: leflunomide therapy is usually started with a loading dose of 100 mgonce daily for 3 days.  Omission of the loading dose may decrease the risk of adverse events(see section 5.1).
The recommended maintenance dose is leflunomide 10 mg to 20 mg once daily depending onthe severity (activity) of the disease.
The therapeutic effect usually starts after 4 to 6 weeks and may further improve up to 4 to 6 months.
There is no dose adjustment recommended in patients with mild renal insufficiency.
No dosage adjustment is required in patients above 65 years of age.
Paediatric populationLeflunomide Teva is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years since efficacy and safety injuvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) have not been established (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Method of administrationLeflunomide Teva tablets should be swallowed whole with sufficient amounts of liquid. The extent ofleflunomide absorption is not affected if it is taken with food.
4.3 Contraindications• Hypersensitivity to the active substance (especially previous Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxicepidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
• Patients with impairment of liver function.
• Patients with severe immunodeficiency states, e.g. AIDS.
• Patients with significantly impaired bone marrow function or significant anaemia, leucopenia,neutropenia or thrombocytopenia due to causes other than rheumatoid arthritis.
• Patients with serious infections (see section 4.4).
• Patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, because insufficient clinical experience isavailable in this patient group.
• Patients with severe hypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome.
• Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraceptionduring treatment with leflunomide and thereafter as long as the plasma levels of the activemetabolite are above 0.02 mg/l (see section 4.6). Pregnancy must be excluded before start oftreatment with leflunomide.
• Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for useConcomitant administration of hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) is notadvisable.
Medicinal productnlongerauthorised4The active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, has a long half-life, usually 1 to 4 weeks. Seriousundesirable effects might occur (e.g. hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity or allergic reactions, see below),even if the treatment with leflunomide has been stopped. Therefore, when such toxicities occur or iffor any other reason A771726 needs to be cleared rapidly from the body, the washout procedure has tobe followed. The procedure may be repeated as clinically necessary.
For washout procedures and other recommended actions in case of desired or unintended pregnancysee section 4.6.
Liver reactionsRare cases of severe liver injury, including cases with fatal outcome, have been reported duringtreatment with leflunomide. Most of the cases occurred within the first 6 months of treatment.
Co-treatment with other hepatotoxic medicinal products was frequently present. It is consideredessential that monitoring recommendations are strictly adhered to.
ALT (SGPT) must be checked before initiation of leflunomide and at the same frequency as thecomplete blood cell count (every two weeks) during the first six months of treatment and every8 weeks thereafter.
For ALT (SGPT) elevations between 2- and 3-fold the upper limit of normal, dose reduction from20 mg to 10 mg may be considered and monitoring must be performed weekly. If ALT (SGPT)elevations of more than 2-fold the upper limit of normal persist or if ALT elevations of more than3-fold the upper limit of normal are present, leflunomide must be discontinued and wash-outprocedures initiated. It is recommended that monitoring of liver enzymes be maintained afterdiscontinuation of leflunomide treatment, until liver enzyme levels have normalised.
Due to a potential for additive hepatotoxic effects, it is recommended that alcohol consumption beavoided during treatment with leflunomide.
Since the active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, is highly protein bound and cleared via hepaticmetabolism and biliary secretion, plasma levels of A771726 are expected to be increased in patientswith hypoproteinaemia. Leflunomide Teva is contraindicated in patients with severe hypoproteinaemiaor impairment of liver function (see section 4.3).
Haematological reactionsTogether with ALT, a complete blood cell count, including differential white blood cell count andplatelets, must be performed before start of leflunomide treatment as well as every 2 weeks for the first6 months of treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter.
In patients with pre-existing anaemia, leucopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia as well as in patients withimpaired bone marrow function or those at risk of bone marrow suppression, the risk ofhaematological disorders is increased. If such effects occur, a washout (see below) to reduce plasmalevels of A771726 should be considered.
In case of severe haematological reactions, including pancytopenia, Leflunomide Teva and anyconcomitant myelosuppressive treatment must be discontinued and a leflunomide washout procedureinitiated.
Combinations with other treatmentsMedicinal productnolongerauthorised5The use of leflunomide with antimalarials used in rheumatic diseases (e.g. chloroquine andhydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and otherimmunosuppressive agents including Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha-Inhibitors has not beenadequately studied up to now in randomised trials (with the exception of methotrexate, seesection 4.5). The risk associated with combination therapy, in particular in long-term treatment, isunknown. Since such therapy can lead to additive or even synergistic toxicity (e.g. hepato- orhaematotoxicity), combination with another DMARD (e.g. methotrexate) is not advisable.
Caution is advised when leflunomide is given together with drugs, other than NSAIDs, metabolised byCYP2C9 such as phenytoin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and tolbutamide.
Switching to other treatmentsAs leflunomide has a long persistence in the body, a switching to another DMARD (e.g. methotrexate)without performing the washout procedure (see below) may raise the possibility of additive risks evenfor a long time after the switching (i.e. kinetic interaction, organ toxicity).
Similarly, recent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. methotrexate)may result in increased side effects; therefore, the initiation of leflunomide treatment has to carefullybe considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects and closer monitoring is recommended in the initialphase after switching.
Skin reactionsIn case of ulcerative stomatitis, leflunomide administration should be discontinued.
Very rare cases of Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported inpatients treated with leflunomide. As soon as skin and/or mucosal reactions are observed which raisethe suspicion of such severe reactions, Leflunomide Teva and any other possibly associated treatmentmust be discontinued, and a leflunomide washout procedure initiated immediately. A completewashout is essential in such cases. In such cases re-exposure to leflunomide is contra-indicated (seesection 4.3).
Pustular psoriasis and worsening of psoriasis have been reported after the use of leflunomide.
Treatment withdrawal may be considered taking into account patient’s disease and past history.
InfectionsIt is known that medicinal products with immunosuppressive properties - like leflunomide - may causepatients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections. Infections may bemore severe in nature and may, therefore, require early and vigorous treatment. In the event thatsevere, uncontrolled infections occur, it may be necessary to interrupt leflunomide treatment andadminister a washout procedure as described below.
Rare cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported in patientsreceiving leflunomide among other immunosuppressants.
The risk of tuberculosis should be considered. A tuberculin reaction test should be considered forthose patients with other tuberculosis risk factors.
Respiratory reactionsMedicinal productnolongerauthorised6Interstitial lung disease has been reported during treatment with leflunomide (see section 4.8). The riskof its occurrence is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease.
Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder, which may occur acutely during therapy.
Pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, may be a reason for discontinuation of the therapyand for further investigation, as appropriate.
Peripheral NeuropathyCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving Leflunomide Teva. Mostpatients improved after discontinuation of Leflunomide Teva. However there was a wide variability infinal outcome, i.e. in some patients the neuropathy resolved and some patients had persistentsymptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increasethe risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking Leflunomide Teva develops a peripheralneuropathy, consider discontinuing Leflunomide Teva therapy and performing the drug eliminationprocedure (see section 4.4).
Blood pressureBlood pressure must be checked before the start of leflunomide treatment and periodically thereafter.
Procreation (recommendations for men)Male patients should be aware of the possible male-mediated foetal toxicity. Reliable contraceptionduring treatment with leflunomide should also be guaranteed.
There are no specific data on the risk of male-mediated foetal toxicity. However, animal studies toevaluate this specific risk have not been conducted. To minimise any possible risk, men wishing tofather a child should consider discontinuing use of leflunomide and taking colestyramine 8 g 3 timesdaily for 11 days or 50 g of activated powdered charcoal 4 times daily for 11 days.
In either case the A771726 plasma concentration is then measured for the first time. Thereafter, theA771726 plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least 14 days. If bothplasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l, and after a waiting period of at least 3 months, the risk offoetal toxicity is very low.
Washout procedureColestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily. Alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal isadministered 4 times daily. Duration of a complete washout is usually 11 days. The duration may bemodified depending on clinical or laboratory variables.
LactoseLeflunomide Teva contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance,the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactionInteractions studies have only been performed in adults.
Increased side effects may occur in case of recent or concomitant use of hepatotoxic or haematotoxicdrugs or when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a washout period (see alsoMedicinal productnolongerauthorised7guidance concerning combination with other treatments, section 4.4). Therefore, closer monitoring ofliver enzymes and haematological parameters is recommended in the initial phase after switching.
In a small (n=30) study with co-administration of leflunomide (10 to 20 mg per day) withmethotrexate (10 to 25 mg per week) a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen on 5 of30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation ofleflunomide. A more than 3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide.
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no pharmacokinetic interaction between the leflunomide (10 to20 mg per day) and methotrexate (10 to 25 mg per week) was demonstrated.
It is recommended that patients receiving leflunomide are not treated with colestyramine or activatedpowdered charcoal because this leads to a rapid and significant decrease in plasma A771726 (theactive metabolite of leflunomide; see also section 5) concentration. The mechanism is thought to be byinterruption of enterohepatic recycling and/or gastrointestinal dialysis of A771726.
If the patient is already receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/orcorticosteroids, these may be continued after starting leflunomide.
The enzymes involved in the metabolism of leflunomide and its metabolites are not exactly known. Anin vivo interaction study with cimetidine (non-specific cytochrome P450 inhibitor) has demonstrated alack of a significant interaction. Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomideto subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampicin (non-specific cytochrome P450 inducer) A771726peak levels were increased by approximately 40 %, whereas the AUC was not significantly changed.
The mechanism of this effect is unclear.
In vitro studies indicate that A771726 inhibits cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) activity. In clinicaltrials no safety problems were observed when leflunomide and NSAIDs metabolised by CYP2C9 wereco-administered. Caution is advised when leflunomide is given together with drugs, other thanNSAIDs, metabolised by CYP2C9 such as phenytoin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and tolbutamide.
In a study in which leflunomide was given concomitantly with a triphasic oral contraceptive pillcontaining 30 μg ethinyloestradiol to healthy female volunteers, there was no reduction incontraceptive activity of the pill, and A771726 pharmacokinetics were within predicted ranges.
VaccinationsNo clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations under leflunomide treatment.
Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life ofleflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live attenuated vaccine afterstopping Leflunomide Teva.
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactationPregnancyThe active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726 is suspected to cause serious birth defects whenadministered during pregnancy. Leflunomide Teva is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).
Medicinal productnolongerauthorised8Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 2 years aftertreatment (see “waiting period” below) or up to 11 days after treatment (see abbreviated “washoutperiod” below).
The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspectpregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing, and if positive, thephysician and patient must discuss the risk to the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering theblood level of the active metabolite, by instituting the drug elimination procedure described below, atthe first delay of menses may decrease the risk to the foetus from leflunomide.
In a small prospective study in women (n=64) who became inadvertently pregnant while takingleflunomide for no more than three weeks after conception and followed by a drug eliminationprocedure, no significant differences (p=0.13) were observed in the overall rate of major structuraldefects (5.4%) compared to either of the comparison groups (4.2% in the disease matched group[n=108] and 4.2% in healthy pregnant women [n=78]).
For women receiving leflunomide treatment and who wish to become pregnant, one of the followingprocedures is recommended in order to ascertain that the foetus is not exposed to toxic concentrationsof A771726 (target concentration below 0.02 mg/l):
Waiting periodA771726 plasma levels can be expected to be above 0.02 mg/l for a prolonged period. Theconcentration may be expected to decrease below 0.02 mg/l about 2 years after stopping the treatmentwith leflunomide.
After a 2-year waiting period, the A771726 plasma concentration is measured for the first time.
Thereafter, the A771726 plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least14 days. If both plasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l no teratogenic risk is to be expected.
For further information on the sample testing please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or itslocal representative (see section 7).
Washout procedureAfter stopping treatment with leflunomide:
• colestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily for a period of 11 days,• alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal is administered 4 times daily for a periodof 11 days.
However, also following either of the washout procedures, verification by 2 separate tests at aninterval of at least 14 days and a waiting period of one-and-a-half months between the first occurrenceof a plasma concentration below 0.02 mg/l and fertilisation is required.
Women of childbearing potential should be told that a waiting period of 2 years after treatmentdiscontinuation is required before they may become pregnant. If a waiting period of up toapproximately 2 years under reliable contraception is considered unpractical, prophylactic institutionof a washout procedure may be advisable.
Both colestyramine and activated powdered charcoal may influence the absorption of oestrogens andprogestogens such that reliable contraception with oral contraceptives may not be guaranteed duringMedicil productnolongerauthorised9the washout procedure with colestyramine or activated powdered charcoal. Use of alternativecontraceptive methods is recommended.
Breast-feedingAnimal studies indicate that leflunomide or its metabolites pass into breast milk. Breast-feedingwomen must, therefore, not receive leflunomide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machinesIn the case of side effects such as dizziness the patient's ability to concentrate and to react properlymay be impaired. In such cases patients should refrain from driving cars and using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effectsSummary of the safety profileThe most frequently reported adverse effects with leflunomide are: mild increase in blood pressure,leucopenia, paraesthesia, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, oral mucosal disorders(e.g. aphthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration), abdominal pain, increased hair loss, eczema, rash(including maculo-papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, tenosynovitis, CPK increased, anorexia, weightloss (usually insignificant), asthenia, mild allergic reactions and elevation of liver parameters(transaminases (especially ALT), less often gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatise, bilirubin))Classification of expected frequencies:
Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the availabledata).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Infections and infestationsRare:    severe infections, including sepsis which may be fatalLike other agents with immunosuppressive potential, leflunomide may increase susceptibility toinfections, including opportunistic infections (see also section 4.4). Thus, the overall incidence ofinfections can increase (in particular of rhinitis, bronchitis and pneumonia).
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with use of someimmunosuppressive agents.

There wereno adverse events reported in the majority of case reports of overdose. Adverse events consistent withthe safety profile for leflunomide were: abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, elevated liver enzymes,anaemia, leucopenia, pruritus and rash.
ManagementIn the event of an overdose or toxicity, colestyramine or charcoal is recommended to accelerateelimination. Colestyramine given orally at a dose of 8 g three times a day for 24 hours to three healthyvolunteers decreased plasma levels of A771726 by approximately 40 % in 24 hours and by 49 % to65 % in 48 hours.
Administration of activated charcoal (powder made into a suspension) orally or via nasogastric tube(50 g every 6 hours for 24 hours) has been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of the activemetabolite A771726 by 37 % in 24 hours and by 48 % in 48 hours.
These washout procedures may be repeated if clinically necessary.
Studies with both hemodialysis and CAPD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) indicate thatA771726, the primary metabolite of leflunomide, is not dialysable.
5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES5.1  Pharmacodynamic propertiesMdicinal productnolongerauthorised12Pharmacotherapeutic group: selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA13.
Human pharmacologyLeflunomide is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agent with antiproliferative properties.
Animal pharmacologyLeflunomide is effective in animal models of arthritis and of other autoimmune diseases andtransplantation, mainly if administered during the sensitisation phase. It hasimmunomodulating/immunosuppressive characteristics, acts as an antiproliferative agent, and displaysanti-inflammatory properties. Leflunomide exhibits the best protective effects on animal models ofautoimmune diseases when administered in the early phase of the disease progression.
In vivo, it is rapidly and almost completely metabolised to A771726 which is active in vitro, and ispresumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect.
Mechanism of actionA771726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotatedehydrogenase (DHODH) and exhibits antiproliferative activity.
Clinical efficacy and safetyRheumatoid arthritisThe efficacy of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated in 4 controlledtrials (1 in phase II and 3 in phase III). The phase II trial, study YU203, randomised 402 subjects withactive rheumatoid arthritis to placebo (n=102), leflunomide 5 mg (n=95), 10 mg (n=101) or 25 mg/day(n=104). The treatment duration was 6 months.
All leflunomide patients in the phase III trials used an initial dose of 100 mg for 3 days.
Study MN301 randomised 358 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day(n=133), sulphasalazine 2 g/day (n=133), or placebo (n=92). Treatment duration was 6 months.
Study MN303 was an optional 6-month blinded continuation of MN301 without the placebo arm,resulting in a 12-month comparison of leflunomide and sulphasalazine.
Study MN302 randomised 999 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day(n=501) or methotrexate at 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=498). Folate supplementationwas optional and only used in 10 % of patients. Treatment duration was 12-months.
Study US301 randomised 482 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day(n=182), methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=182), or placebo (n=118). Allpatients received folate 1 mg bid. Treatment duration was 12 months.
Leflunomide at a daily dose of at least 10 mg (10 to 25 mg in study YU203, 20 mg in studies MN301and US301) was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms ofrheumatoid arthritis in all 3 placebo-controlled trials. The ACR (American College of Rheumatology)response rates in study YU203 were 27.7 % for placebo, 31.9 % for 5 mg, 50.5 % for 10 mg andMedicinal productnolongerauthorised1354.5 % for 25 mg/day. In the phase III trials, the ACR response rates for leflunomide 20 mg/day vs.
placebo were 54.6 % vs. 28.6 % (study MN301), and 49.4 % vs. 26.3 % (study US301).After12 months with active treatment, the ACR response rates in leflunomide patients were 52.3 % (studiesMN301/303), 50.5 % (study MN302) and 49.4 % (study US301), compared to 53.8 % (studiesMN301/303) in sulphasalazine patients, 64.8 % (study MN302), and 43.9 % (study US301) inmethotrexate patients. In study MN302 leflunomide was significantly less effective than methotrexate.
However, in study US301 no significant differences were observed between leflunomide andmethotrexate in the primary efficacy parameters. No difference was observed between leflunomideand sulphasalazine (study MN301). The leflunomide treatment effect was evident by 1 month,stabilised by 3 to 6 months and continued throughout the course of treatment.
A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority study compared the relative efficacy of twodifferent daily maintenance doses of leflunomide, 10 mg and 20 mg. From the results it can beconcluded that efficacy results of the 20 mg maintenance dose were more favourable, on the otherhand, the safety results favoured the 10 mg daily maintenance dose.
Paediatric populationLeflunomide was studied in a single multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in94 patients (47 per arm) with polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were3-17 years of age with active polyarticular course JRA regardless of onset type and naive tomethotrexate or leflunomide. In this trial, the loading dose and maintenance dose of leflunomide wasbased on three weight categories: < 20 kg, 20-40 kg, and > 40 kg. After 16 weeks treatment, thedifference in response rates was statistically significant in favour of methotrexate for the JRADefinition of Improvement (DOI) ≥ 30 % (p = 0.02). In responders, this response was maintainedduring 48 weeks. (see section 4.2).
The pattern of adverse events of leflunomide and methotrexate seems to be similar, but the dose usedin lighter subjects resulted in a relatively low exposure (see section 5.2). These data do not allow aneffective and safe dose recommendation.
Postmarketing StudiesA randomised study assessed the clinical efficacy response rate in DMARD-naïve patients (n=121)with early RA, who received either 20 mg or 100 mg of leflunomide in two parallel groups during theinitial three day double blind period. The initial period was followed by an open label maintenanceperiod of three months, during which both groups received leflunomide 20 mg daily. No incrementaloverall benefit was observed in the studied population with the use of a loading dose regimen. Thesafety data obtained from both treatment groups were consistent with the known safety profile ofleflunomide, however, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and of elevated liver enzymestended to be higher in the patients receiving the loading dose of 100 mg leflunomide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic propertiesLeflunomide is rapidly converted to the active metabolite, A771726, by first-pass metabolism (ringopening) in gut wall and liver. In a study with radiolabelled 14C-leflunomide in three healthyvolunteers, no unchanged leflunomide was detected in plasma, urine or faeces. In other studies,unchanged leflunomide levels in plasma have rarely been detected, however, at ng/ml plasma levels.
The only plasma-radiolabelled metabolite detected was A771726. This metabolite is responsible foressentially all the in vivo activity of leflunomide.
Medicinal productnolonger auhorised14AbsorptionExcretion data from the 14C study indicated that at least about 82 to 95 % of the dose is absorbed. Thetime to peak plasma concentrations of A771726 is very variable; peak plasma levels can occurbetween 1 hour and 24 hours after single administration. Leflunomide can be administered with food,since the extent of absorption is comparable in the fed and fasting state. Due to the very longhalf-lifeof A771726 (approximately 2 weeks), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinicalstudies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady-state levels of A771726. Without a loading dose, itis estimated that attainment of steady-state plasma concentrations would require nearly two months ofdosing. In multiple dose studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the pharmacokinetic parametersof A771726 were linear over the dose range of 5 to 25 mg. In these studies, the clinical effect wasclosely related to the plasma concentration of A771726 and to the daily dose of leflunomide. At a doselevel of 20 mg/day, average plasma concentration of A771726 at steady state is approximately35 μg/ml. At steady state plasma levels accumulate about 33- to 35-fold compared with single dose.
DistributionIn human plasma, A771726 is extensively bound to protein (albumin). The unbound fraction ofA771726 is about 0.62 %. Binding of A771726 is linear in the therapeutic concentration range.
Binding of A771726 appeared slightly reduced and more variable in plasma from patients withrheumatoid arthritis or chronic renal insufficiency. The extensive protein binding of A771726 couldlead to displacement of other highly-bound drugs. In vitro plasma protein binding interaction studieswith warfarin at clinically relevant concentrations, however, showed no interaction. Similar studiesshowed that ibuprofen and diclofenac did not displace A771726, whereas the unbound fraction ofA771726 is increased 2- to 3-fold in the presence of tolbutamide. A771726 displaced ibuprofen,diclofenac and tolbutamide but the unbound fraction of these drugs is only increased by 10 % to 50 %.
There is no indication that these effects are of clinical relevance. Consistent with extensive proteinbinding A771726 has a low apparent volume of distribution (approximately 11 litres). There is nopreferential uptake in erythrocytes.
BiotransformationLeflunomide is metabolised to one primary (A771726) and many minor metabolites including TFMA(4-trifluoromethylaniline). The metabolic biotransformation of leflunomide to A771726 andsubsequent metabolism of A771726 is not controlled by a single enzyme and has been shown to occurin microsomal and cytosolic cellular fractions. Interaction studies with cimetidine (non-specificcytochrome P450 inhibitor) and rifampicin (non-specific cytochrome P450 inducer), indicate that invivo CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of leflunomide only to a small extent.
EliminationElimination of A771726 is slow and characterised by an apparent clearance of about 31 ml/hr. Theelimination half-life in patients is approximately 2 weeks. After administration of a radiolabelled doseof leflunomide, radioactivity was equally excreted in faeces, probably by biliary elimination, and inurine. A771726 was still detectable in urine and faeces 36 days after a single administration. Theprincipal urinary metabolites were glucuronide products derived from leflunomide (mainly in 0 to24 hour samples) and an oxanilic acid derivative of A771726. The principal faecal component wasA771726.
It has been shown in man that administration of an oral suspension of activated powdered charcoal orcolestyramine leads to a rapid and significant increase in A771726 elimination rate and decline inMedicinal productnolongerauthorised15plasma concentrations (see section 4.9). This is thought to be achieved by a gastrointestinal dialysismechanism and/or by interrupting enterohepatic recycling.
Renal impairmentLeflunomide was administered as a single oral 100 mg dose to 3 haemodialysis patients and 3 patientson continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The pharmacokinetics of A771726 in CAPD subjectsappeared to be similar to healthy volunteers. A more rapid elimination of A771726 was observed inhaemodialysis subjects which was not due to extraction of drug in the dialysate.
Hepatic impairmentNo data are available regarding treatment of patients with hepatic impairment. The active metaboliteA771726 is extensively protein bound and cleared via hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion. Theseprocesses may be affected by hepatic dysfunction.
Paediatric populationThe pharmacokinetics of A771726 following oral administration of leflunomide have beeninvestigated in 73 pediatric patients with polyarticular course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)who ranged in age from 3 to 17 years. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis of thesetrials have demonstrated that pediatric patients with body weights ≤ 40 kg have a reduced systemicexposure (measured by Css) of A771726 relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section4.2).
ElderlyPharmacokinetic data in elderly (> 65 years) are limited but consistent with pharmacokinetics inyounger adults.
5.3 Preclinical safety dataLeflunomide, administered orally and intraperitoneally, has been studied in acute toxicity studies inmice and rats. Repeated oral administration of leflunomide to mice for up to 3 months, to rats and dogsfor up to 6 months and to monkeys for up to 1 month's duration revealed that the major target organsfor toxicity were bone marrow, blood, gastrointestinal tract, skin, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes.
The main effects were anaemia, leucopenia, decreased platelet counts and panmyelopathy and reflectthe basic mode of action of the compound (inhibition of DNA synthesis). In rats and dogs, Heinzbodies and/or Howell-Jolly bodies were found. Other effects found on heart, liver, cornea andrespiratory tract could be explained as infections due to immunosuppression. Toxicity in animals wasfound at doses equivalent to human therapeutic doses.
Leflunomide was not mutagenic. However, the minor metabolite TFMA (4-trifluoromethylaniline)caused clastogenicity and point mutations in vitro, whilst insufficient information was available on itspotential to exert this effect in vivo.
In a carcinogenicity study in rats, leflunomide did not show carcinogenic potential. In acarcinogenicity study in mice an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma occurred in males of thehighest dose group, considered to be due to the immunosuppressive activity of leflunomide. In femalemice an increased incidence, dose-dependent, of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas of theMeicinal productnologer authorised16lung was noted. The relevance of the findings in mice relative to the clinical use of leflunomide isuncertain.
Leflunomide was not antigenic in animal models.
Leflunomide was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses in the human therapeuticrange and exerted adverse effects on male reproductive organs in repeated dose toxicity studies.
Fertility was not reduced.

4. CLINICAL PARTICULARSLeflunomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis as a"disease modifying antirheumatic drug" (DMARD).
Recent or concurrent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) mayresult in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions; therefore, the initiation of leflunomidetreatment has to be carefully considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects.
Moreover, switching from leflunomide to another DMARD without following the washout procedure(see section 4.4) may also increase the risk of serious adverse reactions even for a long time after theswitching.

-Indication:
Imatinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of• paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+)chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered asthe first line of treatment.
• paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, orin accelerated phase or blast crisis.
• adults patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis.
• adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblasticleukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy.
• adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy.
• adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated withplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements.
• adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilicleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement.
• adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patientswith recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery.
The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.
In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological andcytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML., on haematological and cytogeneticresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and onobjective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic  DFSP. The experiencewith imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is verylimited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increasedsurvival for these diseases.

- in adults with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis for the treatment of severeanaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in patients (see section 4.4).
Abseamed is indicated in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma ormultiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient’s general status (e.g.
cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy) for the treatment of anaemiaand reduction of transfusion requirements.
Abseamed is indicated in adults in a predonation programme to increase the yield of autologous blood.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] concentrationrange between 10 to 13 g/dl [6.2 to 8.1 mmol/l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are notavailable or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood(4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Abseamed is indicated for non-iron deficient adults prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, havinga high perceived risk for transfusion complications to reduce exposure to allogeneic bloodtransfusions. Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. haemoglobinconcentration range between 10 to 13 g/dl or 6.2 to 8.1 mmol/l) who do not have an autologouspredonation programme available and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1,800 ml).

Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin[Hb] concentration range between 10 to 13 g/dl [6.2 to 8.1 mmol/l], no iron deficiency), if bloodsaving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requiresa large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is indicated for non-iron deficient adults prior to major elective orthopaedicsurgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications to reduce exposure to allogeneicblood transfusions. Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. haemoglobinconcentration range between 10 to 13 g/dl or 6.2 to 8.1 mmol/l) who do not have an autologouspredonation programme available and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1,800 ml).

-Indication:
Trizivir is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir,lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar doses. It is recommended that treatment isstarted with abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine separately for the first 6-8 weeks (see section 4.4).
The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, butmainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.
The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed intreatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease.
In patients with high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration(see section 5.1).
Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to thatobtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted Protease inhibitors or non nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under specialcircumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis).
Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should beperformed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin(see section 4.4).  Abacavir shouldnot be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele.

-Indication:
Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)infection in adults, children 3-years of age or older and adolescents and must only be used as part of acombination regimen with interferon alfa-2b. Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used.
There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e.
not alfa-2b).
Naïve patientsAdult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, forthe treatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previouslytreated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who arepositive for hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid HCV-RNA (see section 4.4).
Paediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V.
is indicated in a combination regimen with interferon alfa2b, for the treatment of children andadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, notpreviously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.
When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combinationtherapy induced a growth inhibition, that may be irreversible in some patients.
The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).
Previous treatment failure patientsAdult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, forthe treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have previously responded (withnormalisation of ALT at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who havesubsequently relapsed (see section 5.1).

Chronic hepatitis CBefore initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinicaltrials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1).
Adult patientsIntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevatedtransaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA(HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4).
The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
Children 3 years of age and older and adolescentsIntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years ofage and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liverdecompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.
When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combinationtherapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients.
The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).
Hairy cell leukaemiaTreatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.
Chronic myelogenous leukaemiaMonotherapyTreatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronicmyelogenous leukaemia.
3Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response isobtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by < 34 % Ph+leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is  34 %, but < 90 % Ph+ cells in themarrow.
Combination therapyThe combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 monthsof treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responsesand to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2bmonotherapy.
Multiple myelomaAs maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reductionin myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy.
Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b prolongs theplateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated.
Follicular lymphomaTreatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combinationinduction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having atleast one of the following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites(each > 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss > 10 %, pyrexia > 38°C for more than 8 days, ornocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compressionsyndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.
Carcinoid tumourTreatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with "carcinoid syndrome".
Malignant melanomaAs adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemicrecurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement.

- Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result ofcongenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD shouldbe re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth.
In patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondaryto a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2off growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence ofprofound GHD.
All other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test.

-Indication:
Treatment of influenzaIn patients one year of age and older who present with symptoms typical of influenza, when influenzavirus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been demonstrated when treatment is initiatedwithin two days of first onset of symptoms. This indication is based on clinical studies of naturallyoccurring influenza in which the predominant infection was influenza A (see section 5.1).
Ebilfumin is indicated for the treatment of infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemicinfluenza outbreak (see section 5.2). The treating physician should take into account thepathogenicity of the circulating strain and the underlying condition of the patient to ensure there is apotential benefit to the child.
Prevention of influenza
- Post-exposure prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with aclinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community.

- The appropriate use of Ebilfumin for prevention of influenza should be determined on a caseby case basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptionalsituations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and apandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age orolder.

- Ebilfumin is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year ofage during a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2).
Ebilfumin is not a substitute for influenza vaccination.
The use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis ofofficial recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxisshould take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenzaviruses, available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impactof the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations (see section 5.1).

Grastofil is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrileneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with theexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in theduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrowtransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety andefficacy of Grastofil are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Grastofil is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs).
In patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with anabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections,long term administration of Grastofil is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce theincidence and duration of infection-related events.
Grastofil is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x109/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infectionswhen other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.

• adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patientswith recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery.
The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.
In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological andcytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogeneticresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and onobjective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experiencewith imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is verylimited (see section 5.1). Except in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, there are no controlled trialsdemonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases.
